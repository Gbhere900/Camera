Thanks for purchasing this package.

I hope you are going to have as much fun building your NEW Exteriors, as I have had compiling this package.
Please could you STAR rate and possible review the package, it really assist others in making informed purchases when spending there hard earned money :)

The Package Prefabs can be found at
Assets\3DForge\FantasyExteriors\Village & Towns\Prefabs\Base\Roofs\Royal

The 20 Handcrafted Premium BLUEPRINTS can be found at
Assets\3DForge\Blueprints\PremiumBlueprints\PB_VEK\RoyalQuarters\BLUEPRINTS

The New Textures/Materails can be applied by simply Dragging and Dropping the NEW ALT1 or ALT2 material onto a prefab in the scene.
This emmediatly changes the prefab's look.
Once you happy with the newly done desing, make a new prefab and chage the name.
In this way you will be compiling your own custom Buildings Library for future use.

There is a simple one page image that also shows this in this same folder by the name of How to use Royal Qaurters textures.jpg that visually shows and explain the same.

Mobile & Desktop:
The textures sheets has intuitive atlas textures usage, with a huge amount of prefabs reading of each textures sheet.
This will assist with lowered draw calls especially when using Static Batching or MeshCombine functions.


Enjoy
